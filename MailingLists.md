The JACK DEVEL mailing list, intended for developers, can be found under:
http://lists.jackaudio.org/listinfo.cgi/jack-devel-jackaudio.org

The LAU List is also a good place for end-users to ask questions about JACK:

For end-users and people who prefer a web-based forum, http://linuxmusicians.com might be a good resource.
