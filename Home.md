Welcome to the **JACK Audio Connection Kit** wiki! 

Notice: this wiki is undergoing renovation, not all content is currently up-to-date. Drop into [IRC](https://kiwiirc.com/nextclient/#irc://irc.freenode.net/#jack) for the latest.

**jackd** is the JACK audio server daemon that allows JACK client programs to process and route audio and MIDI data in a synchronous, sample-accurate and low\-latency manner. Originally written for the GNU/Linux operating system, it also runs on various Unix platforms, Mac OS X and MS Windows.

JACK can connect a number of different client applications to an audio device and also to each other. Most clients are external, running in their own processes as normal applications. JACK also supports internal clients, which run within the jackd process using a loadable "plugin" interface.

JACK differs from other audio servers in being designed from the ground up for professional audio work. It focuses on two key areas: synchronous execution of all clients, and low latency operation.

## Session management
Both LASH/LADISH and JACK Session are deprecated, and the use of [NSM](https://linuxaudio.github.io/new-session-manager) and an NSM GUI like [Agordejo](https://laborejo.org/agordejo/) is recommended.

NSM clients usually come with `jackpatch`, which automatically saves connections but isn't the most robust of software.
